# Simple Item-to-Item Recommendation System

This repository contains a basic item-to-item recommendation system using a co-click dataset. The system works by analyzing clickstream data (user clicks on items) and identifying items that are frequently clicked together. It can generate simple recommendations, like "You may also like..." for each product based on co-click relationships.

## Overview

### Purpose
This project provides a straightforward recommendation model that suggests items commonly clicked along with a given item. It's suitable for beginners looking to understand how basic recommendation systems work and for projects with relatively simple data requirements.

### How It Works

- **Clickstream Data**: The recommendation system is based on clickstream data, where each row in the dataset represents a user clicking on an item.
  
- **Co-Click Frequency**: For each item, the system counts how often it is clicked along with other items. Items frequently clicked together are considered related.

- **Recommendations**: When a user views a particular item, the system can recommend other items that are commonly clicked with it.
